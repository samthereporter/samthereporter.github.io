Many communities were forcibly relocated to Road Allowances in the Prairies.\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, the federal government created classes of Métis to guide admission. In a letter from school officials, the three 'classes' were described as:\n\n1. Those who live the ordinary settled life.\n2. Those who live the Indian mode of life.\n3. Those who – and they form the most unfortunate class – are the illegitimate offspring of Indian women.",

The last two “classes” were the children most likely to be institutionalized in residential schools.\n\nFor the most part, school officials were concerned with funding. School officials often manipulated the 'classes' of Métis children to benefit the school’s administration. More children in the schools meant they could receive more funding.",
